Hello! Mackerel team CRE Miura (id:missasan:detail) here.

Last week we announced the Mackerel Advent Calendar, but this year, Inoue (id:a-know:detail) and I are trying our hands at a CRE team specific calendar as well, the Mackerel Advent Calendar 2018 (CRE)!

Now, not only do you have [Mackerel Advent Calendar](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2018/mackerel) to look forward to, but our calendar as well!

Now on to this week’s update information.

## The newly renovated Custom Dashboards

Custom Dashboards is a dashboard feature that lets you freely arrange graphs that you want to see based on usage scenes etc.

With this update, Custom Dashboards has been newly reborn. Now it’s even easier to create and edit dashboards with more flexibility, add graphs by dragging and dropping, change display sizes and positioning, and more.

### Use it in various scenes

Dashboards can be created easily and put to good use in various scenes of server monitoring and operation!

- Daily service status checks
- Reference at weekly/monthly team meetings
- Use in capacity planning
- Look back on the system’s status and effects when the campaign was implemented

### Automatic registration using the API

Even with the new Custom Dashboards, it’s possible to import and export graphs using the API. This lets you automate the creating / editing of custom dashboards.

For more details, check out the following document.

Please note that operations using the mkr command for the new Custom Dashboards are not yet supported.

### The old Custom Dashboards

With this change, the old Custom Dashboards has been renamed "Legacy Custom Dashboards". You can also browse previously created dashboards here.

We recommend that you use the new Custom Dashboards feature when creating a new dashboard.

## check-redis subcommand replication added

`replication` has been added to the subcommands of check-redis. This makes it possible to check whether Redis replication is working properly.  `slave` is a similar subcommand, but understand that it will become obsolete in the future.

## Organization names can now be obtained with mkr org command

The organization name can now be obtained by running `mkr org`. The following execution results are obtained.

```
{
  "name": <name>
}
```
