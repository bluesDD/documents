Mackerel was updated on November 12th! Outlined below are the main things that have changed.

- The following are changes that have been made to the host’s memory usage graphs.
  - Display of total swap space capacity (“swap total”) has now been incorporated into the graph function.
  - Swap space currently being used (“swap used”) has also been added to the graph.  
  - The aforementioned two will now be displayed instead of available swap space (“swap free”), which has been removed.
