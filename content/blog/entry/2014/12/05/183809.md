##Issues with monitoring of CPU usage have been fixed

From September 9, 2014 to December 2, 2014 there have been regular problems with CPU usage monitoring with mackerel-agent after version 0.7. The source of the problem was when the mackerel-agent updated and the metrics which are sent got reorganized, a bug was caused in the web application which wasn't properly adjusting to the change in the agent. This problem has now been taken care of. 

In the case that the metric being targeted by [monitoring](https://mackerel.io/my/monitors) has been designated as CPU%, hosts which have had mackerel-agent version 0.7 or later installed on them were not being able to properly carry out this monitoring. Still, other metrics were not being affected and were continuing to operate as normal.

Even after correcting this function, there is still some concern that error alerts may come up again. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.

With the aim of preventing a problem like this from arising again, we are continually developing and working to improve the update release process.

Thank you for using Mackerel, we truly appreciate your support!

##Now when a monitoring rule's threshold has been changed, pre-existing alerts will be re-checked

Now, when a monitoring rule's threshold has been changed, alerts derived from that monitoring rule will be re-checked against the new threshold and, if they are within the range of the new threshold, will be closed out automatically. Alerts will be re-checked dependent on when the agent posts new metrics.

Until now, when a monitoring rule's threshold was changed, it was necessary to manually close out alerts which were raised under the previously set threshold. Our recent improvements have made doing so no longer necessary, as well as made it easier and simpler to fine-tune your monitoring rules.

##ChatWork and im.kayac.com have been added as notification alert channels
