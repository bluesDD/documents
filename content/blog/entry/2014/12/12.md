##Added support for Typetalk

Now [Typetalk](http://www.typetalk.in/) can also be used in conjunction with Mackerel to receive alert notifications! Using Typetalk's new [Bot API](https://developer.nulab-inc.com/docs/typetalk/auth#tttoken) which was released today, you can now receive alert notifications in your Typetalk topic. In addition, it's now possible to have a different emoji appended to each notification you receive depending on status, which can be configured by the user.

Settings can be configured in the [Typetalk form](https://mackerel.io/my/channels?new=typetalk) in Notification Channels. For more information please refer to our [Help](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/howto/alerts/typetalk) page.

##Sending test notifications

It's now possible to send test notifications from the [Notification Channels Settings page](https://mackerel.io/my/channels). Quickly and easily confirm that your notification channels are working properly and all settings are correct by sending a test notification to each channel you are using.

##Confirm the current value of target metrics directly from the Alert's page and Alert details window

In the [Alert's list screen](https://mackerel.io/alerts) and Alert details window, the current value of the metric being targeted by monitoring (loadavg5, CPU%, etc.) is now visible and can be confirmed.  Displaying the alert's graph and numerical value accordingly, it's now easy to quickly understand the situation at a glance.
