Services and custom dashboards can now be favorited.

Services and custom dashboards that have been favorited will be displayed at the top of the sidebar. This may help you quickly access certain services from the sidebar.

Favorites can be configured from either the details screen or the list screen of both custom dashboards and services. By mousing over the custom dashboard or service name, a star mark will be displayed to the side. Click on the star to set it as a favorite.

Additionally, registered favorites are saved per-user. Even in the case of a single organization being used by multiple people, personal settings can be maintained. 

## Check monitoring can now be specified in the notification group

In Mackerel, check monitoring can be done by using the check plugin.

With this update, including the check monitoring item in the notification group’s “notification target’s monitoring rules” is now possible.

As a result, you will be able to specify the notification target of the check monitor's execution result independently for each key specified in the check monitoring settings. 

## A new look for the API document

The API document has a new look. 

The page has been divided into each category with a link to each page’s header installed in the item name. Now, searching for information is easier than ever. 

By all means, take a look. 

## Introducing user blogs

User entries are being sporadically introduced((A formal guarantee for the link content is not provided. Additionally, a link’s author should contact us if deleting a link is desired.)) in Mackerel Blog. 

This time we are introducing an article by Toreta. Unfortunately, it is only available in Japanese.

Using other various web services while operating our service has become common, but this is an attempt to record the state of an external service using Mackerel. 

We encourage posting any examples of continued Mackerel use!
