Today marks the first day of April.

At Hatena, new employees have entered the company and things have become a bit more lively.
 
Here is this week’s Mackerel update (don’t worry, even though today is April fools’ day, everything in this article is true).

## An API to update hosts’ roles

In the past, you could add roles from the host information updating API, but considering the possibility of a collision with the changes in the Web screen, removal was not possible.
 
With this update, the API was supplemented in order to update role configurations related to the host, including the possibility of removing the role. 


```
PUT /api/v0/hosts/<hostID>/role-fullnames
```

By specifying the following format for hosts whose roles you want to configure, role information will be updated.

```
{
  "roleFullnames": [ <string>, <string>, … ]
}
```


For more details, take a look at the help page.

## Official support for Amazon Linux

In last week's announcement, we informed you about mackerel-agent not working in Amazon Linux AMI 2016.03.

After that, we implemented an emergency response, resolved the problems, and introduced the official support for Amazon Linux in Mackerel.

The Amazon Linux installation procedure is described from Mackerel’s host registration guide screen([https://mackerel.io/my/instruction-agent]).

## Introducing user blogs

User entries are being sporadically introduced((A formal guarantee for the link content is not provided. Additionally, a link’s author should contact us if deleting a link is desired.))  in Mackerel Blog. 

Here are user entries about a convenient way to use Mackerel and a new user-developed plugin. Unfortunately, they are only available in Japanese.

Being able to transfer instantly, such as to a specific host page, with Alfred Workflow seems convenient right?

Recently, i’ve gotten used to Spotlight on Mac, but I think I want to give this a try.
