Here is this week's Mackerel update:

# The Host Display Name could now be obtained/renewed via mkr
 
The Host Display Name could be set to distinguish between hosts in Mackerel.

Hosts that have this property set will be displayed as “display name (host name)” in Mackerel as shown below.

In this update, this field could now be modified via mkr. 

The property `displayName` corresponds to the Host Display Name when using mkr.

```sh
$ mkr hosts
[
    {
        "id": "<hostId>",
        "name": "ip-XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX",
        "displayName": "sample-host",
        "status": "standby",
        "roleFullnames": [
            "personal-server:EC2"
        ],
        "isRetired": false,
        "createdAt": "Nov 7, 2015 at 6:18am (UTC)"
    }
]
```

Updating could be done through mkr as well. 

```sh
$ mkr update --displayName updated-name <hostId>

$ mkr hosts
[
    {
        "id": "<hostId>",
        "name": "ip-XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX",
        "displayName": "updated-name",
        "status": "standby",
        "roleFullnames": [
            "personal-server:EC2"
        ],
        "isRetired": false,
        "createdAt": "Nov 7, 2015 at 6:18am (UTC)"
    }
]
```
