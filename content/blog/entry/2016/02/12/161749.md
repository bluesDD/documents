Here is this week's Mackerel update:

## Hosts overview now allows filtering

In the hosts overview, you can now filter hosts by service, role, or status.

Because the hosts overview also displays CPU and Memory values, this feature can be used to view active hosts according to specific services / roles. 

## Thread IDs can now be specified for Yammer Channels

We added an option for thread IDs in the Yammer channel settings.

Up until this point, each alert was designated a single Yammer channel thread to notify state transitions.

By explicitly setting up a thread ID in the channel settings, all alert notifications will be sent to the same thread.

Thread IDs can be obtained from the URL which you can find by clicking the Yammer thread's time link.
