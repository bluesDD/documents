Thank you for choosing Mackerel.

Regarding our previous announcement and the urgent maintenance scheduled to take place on February 7th (Thur) at 2:30 pm, a resolution for the problem has been found and the scheduled maintenance has been cancelled. The use of Mackerel will continue as usual during that aforementioned time period.

### Reason for cancellation

Weâ€™ve confirmed the restoration of autovacuum in PostgreSQL (RDS), the data store used by Mackerel. And since the problem of the transaction ID being depleted has also been resolved, we have decided that emergency maintenance is unnecessary.

We will continue monitor the situation and make every effort to ensure that the operation of Mackerel is stable in the future.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

Thank you for understanding and cooperation.
