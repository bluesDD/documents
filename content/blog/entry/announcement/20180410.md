Thank you for choosing Mackerel.

As stated in the title, we will stop encrypted communication via TLS 1.0 on June 6th, 2018 (Wednesday).

### Reason for stopping

TLS 1.0 is an outdated encryption protocol and several vulnerabilities have already been confirmed.

PCI SSC, an international organization that defines security standards for credit card payment systems, has required that TLS 1.0 be disabled by June 30th, 2018. ((https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Migrating-from-SSL-Early-TLS-Info-Supp-v1_1.pdf))

In response to this, Mackerel has decided to stop TLS 1.0 communication on June 6th, 2018 (Wednesday).

### Impact range

Browsing for mackerel.io will no longer be available with older OS/browsers that do not support TLS 1.1 or later. Additionally, use of the Mackerel API will no longer be available with older OS/OpenSSL environments.

Please consider using Mackerel in official supported environments ((https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/overview)). If TLS 1.1 or later is not yet supported, please migrate to a supported environment.

We apologize for this inconvenience, but we believe that providing our service in a safe environment is of great importance and we hope that you will understand. 

Thank you
