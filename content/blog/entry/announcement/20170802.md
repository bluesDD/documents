Thank you for choosing Mackerel.

Currently, there is an issue with notifications failing from Mackerel to OpsGenie depending on certain conditions. 

Notification failures occur when a notification from Mackerel is sent to an OpsGenie account that was created after May 30th, 2017. Notifications sent to accounts created before said date have been successful. 

The cause of these failures is due to OpsGenie’s REST API switch to V2.

Mackerel uses OpsGenie's REST API V1 for integration with OpsGenie. V1 and V2 are not compatible, and the use of V1 has been closed for accounts created after May 30th, 2017, which is why notifications from Mackerel are failing.

Mackerel is working on transitioning to the use of API V2, however, specification changes and support analysis will take some time. 
   
Below is the announcement from OpsGenie about their API switch.

We apologize for the inconvenience. 

Another announcement will be made when the issue has been resolved.
