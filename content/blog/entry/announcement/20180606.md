As previously announced, encrypted communication via TLS 1.0 has been stopped as of today (June 6th).

Browsing for mackerel.io will no longer be available with older OS / browsers that do not support TLS 1.1 or later. Additionally, use of the Mackerel API will no longer be available with older OS/OpenSSL environments.

Please consider using Mackerel in official supported environments ((https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/overview)). If TLS 1.1 or later is not yet supported, please migrate to a supported environment.

We apologize for this inconvenience, but we believe that providing our service in a safe environment is of great importance and we hope that you will understand.
