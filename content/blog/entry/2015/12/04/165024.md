And now for this week's Mackerel update.

## Getting graph metric data with the API

This week we have released APIs for getting metric data from host graphs and service graphs.

By designating the host ID (service name), the metric name, and the time span, it's possible to get metric values for that time span using the API.

Using the following command, for example, you can get metrics in tsv format and have them entered into a spreadsheet or charted on your own original graphs.

```
curl -s 'https://mackerel.io/api/v0/hosts/{host_id}/metrics?name=loadavg5&from=1448849164&to=1448935564' -H 'X-Api-Key: {api_key}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X GET | jq -r '.metrics | map("\(.time)\t\(.value)") | join("\n")'
```

For more information please refer to the documentation.

Metric data that is possible to obtain from the API will be saved in 1-minute intervals, and will be rounded into larger intervals as time passes.

For information regarding metric retention, please refer to the following document.
