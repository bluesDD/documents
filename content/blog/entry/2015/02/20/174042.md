##Service metric monitoring rules can now gauge the average of recently posted values

Until now, service metric monitoring rule thresholds were without exception gauged in relation only to the most recently posted value. This has now been changed so that it is also possible to configure service metric monitoring rules to take into account the average of recently posted values, preventing unnecessary alerts resulting from sudden spikes and improving the overall stability of monitoring. 

- It’s possible to configure monitoring rules to use the average of up to 5 recently posted values.
- Data used for average calculation can only be retained for up to 24 hours, which means that if any of the data points you want to have included in an average happen to fall outside of that 24 hours,  that data will not be retained and it will not be possible to carry out the calculation.

##mackerel-agent installer for Windows (alpha) has been released

Until now only the Linux binary for mackerel-agent was being officially offered,  but now we have released an alpha version binary and an installer for Windows as well. Select Microsoft Windows Installer from the [agent installation guide page](https://mackerel.io/my/instruction-agent) and follow the instructions to complete installation.

- The supported OSs are Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2012.
- In order to begin installation a command prompt from an administrator is required.
- If you encounter any problems when using the installer or have any comments or ideas, please drop us a line either by accessing the Feedback function in the upper right hand corner of Mackerel's web interface or through [GitHub](https://github.com/mackerelio/mackerel-agent/issues).

## Monitoring rules as well as open alerts will now be displayed in the host’s details page

Monitoring rules as well as open alerts regarding a host will now be displayed in that host’s details page, making it possible to quickly go from viewing a host that has a problem to directly accessing the alert.
