This week's Mackerel update:

##Sharing graphs as images

Now it’s easier to share graphs by exporting them as images. Exporting graphs as images is useful for embedding many graphs for side-by-side comparison within a single page because they load much faster than interactive graphs. Click on the share button in the top right-hand corner of a graph to export.

Moving forward we’re planning to develop features for getting image notifications in chat integrations and also getting a sharable link that gives access to view a graph.

##Improved display of host status

The display of host status and the status change function have been improved and now clearly show the difference between each status type. For more information about how host statuses, monitoring, and alerts work together please refer to [“Setting up monitoring and alerts.”](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/howto/alerts)
