This week’s Mackerel update:

## Monitor configuration API released

The API for dealing with monitor operations has been released. For more information please refer to [API specs](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/spec/api/v0#monitor-create).

## Monitor configuration now possible from the command line with mkr monitors command

In conjunction with the release of the monitor configuration API, we have added some subcommands for monitor configuration to the command line tool `mkr`. These features can be used with mkr v0.4.0 and later.

With the following sequence of operations, it is now possible to create monitor configurations as a JSON file.

```bash
mkr monitors pull
mkr monitors push
mkr monitors diff
```

For advanced uses please refer to [Managing monitoring rules in GitHub]( https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/advanced/monitors-github).

And for more information about using mkr, please check [Using the mkr CLI tool](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/advanced/cli).
