The summer internship program we talked about last week which began on August 10th is getting close to the home stretch.

This week, in cooperation with our wonderful interns, we’re happy to announce the release of a new feature.

Here’s this week’s Mackerel update!

## Generating read-only API keys

It’s now possible to generate read-only API keys, as well as turn on or off any new API key’s write permission.

This can be used, for example, for API keys that are used to acquire the target role’s host list from Mackerel when deploying, and for other restricted purposes. With this feature, recording API keys in configuration files is even more secure.

Any pre-existing API keys will still have write permission the same as before, so please make any necessary changes.

For all API specs please refer to the following document.

This feature is the result of a collaborative effort between Hatena staff and our interns.

## Searchable alerts

Alerts can now also be searched in Mackerel.

Now, when searching in Mackerel, any alerts tied to matching hosts or monitor configurations will be displayed in the search results along with matching hosts, services, roles, and monitor configurations.

## Search functionality for smartphones

It’s now possible to search in Mackerel even on a smartphone.

You can perform a search by first tapping on the organization icon in the upper left hand corner of the screen and then tapping the magnifying glass icon.
