This weekâ€™s Mackerel update:

##  Get graph images in Slack notifications to stay on top of your open alerts

Now Slack notifications can be configured to display an image of a graph along with its corresponding alert. If you have already integrated your Slack account as a Channel it will still be necessary to update your settings. For details about set-up please refer to [Slack notifications](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/howto/alerts/slack).
