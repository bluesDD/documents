It’s really gotten quite cold here in Kyoto over the past few days.

Actually it suddenly got so cold that I decided it was time to drag out the heavy winter coats from the back of the closet.

But the Mackerel team, not one to be defeated by winter weather, is undeterred as we bring you this week’s Mackerel update!

## HTML alert notification emails

When an alert notification is sent by Mackerel to your email address, that email will be an HTML email.

Now alert notification emails will display the same information as alert details pages, like graphs, alert statuses, history and so on, making it easier to get an idea of the situation just by looking at your email.

Additionally, for those of you who are using Gmail, a `View Alert` button will be displayed along with each email.

Clicking this button will jump directly to the alert details screen of that alert.

## More items are now retrievable with mackerel-plugin-jvm, improved value computation

mackerel-agent-plugins 0.14.2 has been released.

With this update, heap usage rates for the NEW field and OLD field, as well as CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction for CMS GC will be collected via mackerel-plugin-jvm.

Also, as an additional update, value computation when Young GC Time is resetted has been improved. This will help alleviate an anomaly where occasional negative values would be posted to graphs in some environments. 

## Other releases

Updates have been released for mackerel-agent and mackerel-check-plugins.
The following are the main changes that have been made.

#### mackerel-agent 0.25.1
  - Go version is now 1.5.1 when doing a build
  - STDERR will now be outputted to the log when check-plugin in executed

#### mackerel-check-plugins 0.2.1
  - a --no-state option has been added to check-log
  - check-log bug fixes

Big thanks to all of you who made pull requests!

## Mackerel Drinkup in Kyoto!

The first ever Mackerel Drinkup was held this week on November 25th in the conference room of Hatena’s Kyoto office.

[http://mackerelio.connpass.com/event/22057/:title]

Despite the unfortunate weather we had a great crowd turn up on Wednesday for a fun night of drinking, eating, and hanging out with the Mackerel dev team and Hatena infrastructure team.

We were very pleased to get a lot of super helpful feedback from our guests at the event and we will be incorporating that feedback into our future development plans. 

We also had the pleasure of hearing a short presentation from [Nulab’s](https://nulab-inc.com/) Takashi Someda about their experience with Mackerel over the past year and a half. Below is his slide presentation, which unfortunately is only available in Japanese at this time.
