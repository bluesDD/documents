Starting tomorrow we’ve got a nice three day weekend in Japan. Yay!

Pretty soon everyone will be planning their end of the year parties that are a tradition here in Japan. It’s hard to believe 2015 is almost over!

And now for this week’s Mackerel update.

## check-tcp has been added to mackerel-check-plugins

mackerel-check-plugins 0.2.0 has been released.

With this update we have added check-tcp to mackerel-check-plugins.

check-tcp is a plugin that checks the connection to any host or port with TCP.
This can be used, for example, for connectivity monitoring of access point hosts or various kinds of middleware that connect with TCP.

For example usage and options, please refer to this README.

## Links to graphs have been added in alert details pages

It’s now possible to get graph permalinks for the graphs that are displayed in alert details pages.

This is useful for when, for example, you want to share the graph of a metric that’s causing an alert with another team member.


## Performance improvements for host details pages 

Performance improvements have been made on the host details pages. There were some organizations where graph display was particularly slow, but that problem has now largely been taken care of.

Our dev team is constantly working to improving Mackerel’s performance.
If you happen to notice any performance issues, please let us know with the feedback feature.

## Reactio ✕ Mackerel partner campaign

One of Mackerel’s supported notification channels is the incident management tool [Reactio](https://reactio.jp/), provided by a Japanese company called Gaiax.

Right now Reactio is running a campaign where, for those of you who are using Mackerel together with Reactio, if you apply before the end of the year you can get the Reactio standard plan for free for six months.

(As of now, the Reactio service is only being offered in Japanese.)
