At Mackerel, our team members can often be seen wearing the official Mackerel logo blue hoodie to work. It’s exceptionally warm for a hoodie, but now that it’s getting colder I’m starting to think one hoodie alone might not be enough to stay warm any more, especially for those of us who bike to work.

And now for this week’s Mackerel update!

## Alerts API has been added

APIs for getting a list of alerts as well as for closing specified alerts have been added.

This can be used, for example, to automatically close alerts related to any specific host.

For more information, please take a look at the API documentation.

## Log in to Mackerel with your Yammer account

Mackerel supports several OAuth cooperative login methods, and now with this update users will be able to login to Mackerel using a [Yammer](https://www.yammer.com/) account.

Please bear in mind that, although Mackerel only needs to use access tokens with read permission to obtain user information (user ID and public email address), according to Yammer’s scope specification, an access token with write permission will be issued regardless. When logging in to Mackerel, OAuth is used to access users’ information, and the access token which is issued will not be saved internally in Mackerel.

The updates that have been released are as follows.

### mackerel-agent 0.25.0

- can now get network interface metrics in Darwin

### mackerel-check-plugins 0.1.1

## Mackerel Advent Calendar 2015

It’s already November so pretty soon people will be taking part in tech advent calendars.

This year, Mackerel will also be doing an advent calendar.

We hope you’ll join in, and definitely feel free to write in English!

## Drink up event at Mackerel

On November 25th we will be holding a drink up at our Kyoto office!
Until now all of our events have been held primarily in Tokyo, so this will be our first event in Kyoto.

We hope you’ll join us for food, drinks of the alcoholic sort, and good times with Mackerel’s engineers and Hatena’s infrastructure engineers!

## Mackerel in user blogs and presentations 

Lately we’ve been very happy to see, as Mackerel users continue to increase in number, Mackerel being talked about in a number of blog entries and in presentations at events and lectures for engineers.

From time to time we’d like to share a few of these kinds of blog posts and presentations here on our developer blog.((The content of these blog posts are not officially recognized by Mackerel.)) Unfortunately the blog posts below are all in Japanese only, but maybe in the future we’ll have some English posts to share as well!
