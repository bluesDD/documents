## Fine tuning % graphs’ display of highest values
Until now when line graphs were displayed as a percentage, if the highest metrics fell below 100%, graphs would respond by displaying only the area necessary to show the current highest metrics, which made it somewhat difficult to understand as a graph expressing a percentage. 
With this update even if the highest metrics are less than 100%, graphs will automatically display the full value range just as if the highest metric was at 100%, making it easier to intuitively understand data as percentages.

## Display of units when entering a threshold in monitoring settings
When entering a threshold value in the monitoring settings, its units will now be displayed according to the currently selected target metric.

## Mackerel Meetup #4, a huge success!!

This past Tuesday, May 26th we had the pleasure of holding our 4th Mackerel Meetup. Even though we had to postpone once, a lot of people came out and it was a big success! Big thanks to every one who attended!

Continuing on from the last Meetup, [id:stanaka](https://profile.hatena.ne.jp/stanaka/) / [@stanaka](https://twitter.com/stanaka) talked about reporting current status, introduced some slightly different ways to use Mackerel, and our plans for future development.
With the announcement of upcoming features like external monitoring and notification groups, the atmosphere in the room and the big reaction on social media was so positive, it's built up a sense of anticipation that’s got us all tense with excitement.

We’re planning on holding the next Mackerel Meetup in the near future, so we hope you’ll be looking forward to more news about that coming soon.
