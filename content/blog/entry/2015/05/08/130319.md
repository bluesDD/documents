This past week was a holiday known as “Golden Week” here in Japan. It’s a time when people take off work, go on a short vacation and get some r&r.
So today the team here at Mackerel is all rested up and excited to continue bringing you new features and updates!

## Typetalk notifications can now be configured to post graph images with alerts

In past updates we have added graph image alert notifications to Slack and HipChat, and now with this update we are proud to offer this feature with Typetalk notifications as well.

This feature can be turned on or off in the Typetalk channel settings menu.

We plan to continue adding this feature to even more notification channels in the near future.
