This week’s Mackerel update:

## Deleting API keys

In the past we were offering functionality only for creating new API keys, but with this update it will also be possible to delete an API key from within your organization’s [settings screen](https://mackerel.io/my?tab=apikeys).
By deleting an API key it will no longer be able to be accessed, making managing your Mackerel account safer and more secure.
API key deletion can only be done by your organization’s manager.

Also, in coordination with this feature, we’ve moved the API key management controls into its own tab in your organization’s settings screen, making API key management simpler and more convenient than before.
