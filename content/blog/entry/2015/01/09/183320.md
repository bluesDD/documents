## Support has been added for monitoring based on filesystem usage.

Mackerel now supports [monitoring](https://mackerel.io/my/monitors) based on filesystem usage percentage. In the instance of multiple file systems, thresholds which have been configured will behave relative to the filesystem which has the highest usage. Until now monitoring was only being done relative to the absolute value (filesystem.*.used) of filesystem usage and so on, which isn’t really all that useful, so from now on it will be possible to configure thresholds based on a percentage value, as well as targeting the file system capacity of varying hosts with a single monitoring rule.

 In order to configure monitoring to filesystem usage percentage, when creating a new [monitoring](https://mackerel.io/my/monitors) rule, specify Filesystem% as the target metric.

## mackerel-agent v0.14 has been released

The following are the changes that have occurred with mackerel-agent’s most recent update.

- When closing out the agent, if there is still some unsent data the agent will now wait until the sending has been completed to close.
- It’s now possible to build and run mackerel-agent within Windows, Darwin, and FreeBSD. (However, because at the present moment we are not officially able to offer support on Windows, Darwin, or FreeBSD, it will be necessary for users to build the required program themselves from the [repository](https://github.com/mackerelio/mackerel-agent).)
- Other minor updates, changes to improve performance.

## mackerel-agent-plugins v0.6.2 has been released

With the release of mackerel-agent-plugins v0.6.2, we have fixed a bug affecting the JVM plugin. 

## It’s now easier to configure monitoring rule thresholds

We’ve received some much appreciated feedback from Mackerel users regarding difficulty when entering large numbers and confirming their accuracy when configuring monitoring rule thresholds, so we’ve made adjustments accordingly,  going to “M” and “G” to make it easier to see clearly when large values are being displayed.

## Monitoring rules will now be given names automatically.

Until now, when configuring monitoring rules it was necessary to enter a name for the rule, but now we’ve made it so that a name will be assigned automatically from the target metric of the monitoring rule. Depending on necessity, however, it is also possible that a rule’s name will not be automatically generated. 

## Mackerel Meetup #3 Tokyo (1/22 in Roppongi)

Mackerel Meetup #3 will be held the evening of January 22nd in Roppongi. An engineer from FreakOut will be speaking about how they use Mackerel as well, so we really hope you’ll join us!
