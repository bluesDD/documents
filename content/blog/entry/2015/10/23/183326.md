Today at the office I can hear the sounds of traditional Japanese instruments outside as a parade passes by.

As I’m writing this blog post on October 22nd, one of the three biggest festivals in Kyoto, the Jidai Matsuri is going on just outside our office building. People dress up in the traditional clothes representative of various time periods in Japan and parade through the city.

This week’s Mackerel update:

## External URL monitoring is now officially supported

With external URL monitoring, if a there is a certificate error, the monitoring target host doesn’t exist in the first place, or if some kind of response isn’t being received normally, then you will be notified with an error message.

With this, the external URL monitoring feature which we had previously been offering as an experimental feature, will now be an official feature of Mackerel.

From now on external URL monitoring will be available to use regardless of experimental features settings.

※External URL monitoring is only a useable feature of the trial and paid plans.

## Reactio has been added to Notification Channels

Reactio has been added to the growing list of available alert notification channels. 

[Reacito](https://reactio.jp/) is an incident management tool that uses team problem solving to troubleshoot and resolve issues. Reactio is only available in Japanese at this time.

## Page for retired hosts details has become a dedicated page

The page for displaying retired hosts’ details from the list of hosts has now become a dedicated page.

In the new retired hosts page, host metrics will not be displayed, but those metrics will be able to be viewed in the role graphs, so checking the situation with auto scale host reduction can still be done the same way as before.

## Two new Help documents: “Monitoring Heroku with Mackerel” and “Using Mackerel in Auto Scaling environments”

We’ve been getting a lot of requests recently for a concrete explanation of how to use Mackerel in Auto Scaling environments and how to monitor Heroku, so we’ve added a couple of new Help documents that cover those topics.

We hope you’ll take a moment to look them over.
