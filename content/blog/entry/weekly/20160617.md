## The targeted metrics to be retrieved can now be filtered by tags for AWS Integration

We have now enabled support for filtering metric targets to be retrieved through AWS integration by tags.

This can be used, for example, to exclude certain services from being polled in your development environment, achieving more efficient management.

To filter by AWS tags, you must have permission for the API used to retrieve the tags for each service. Check the respective policy and determine whether the actions below can be performed:

- ec2:DescribeTags
- rds:ListTagsForResource
- elasticache:ListTagsForResource

Specifying an ARN for each API requires an account ID, so the permission below is required as well:

- iam:GetUser for linked users

In particular, the `AmazonElastiCacheReadOnlyAccess` management policy on AWS cannot perform the `elasticache:ListTagsForResource` action, so when filtering ElastiCache by tag, the policy must be added.

To add policies, use the Inline Policies process.

For details, please refer to the Help manual.

## Experimental support for expression-based monitoring

You can now use expressions in your monitoring rules.

This allows you to flexibly monitor metrics by parameters such as the average value of role metrics, the difference between the current value and the same value a week ago, et cetera.

- Monitoring occurs on 5 minute intervals
- Expressions allowed for monitoring are those where the graph sequence contains a single line
- If you are unable to retrieve metric values by expression or if the expression is too complex, causing a timeout, the status will change to Unknown and cause an alert
- You can set a maximum of 20 monitoring items
- This feature is available only for Trial and Paid plans

The functions usable in expressions are described in the Help section below.

We plan to revamp the editing functionality to make expression-based monitoring and expression-based graphs easier to input.

Note that this feature is being offered on an experimental basis.

Please see the Help section below for details on use of experimental features.

## Prior Notice: Alert notifications for check monitoring will change

Check monitoring currently sends an alert when the status or message changes.

We are planning on changing this to only send alerts for status changes and to have only the alert details screen to update in the event of a message change.

Since this is a change regarding monitoring, we are notifying users in advance of its release.

We welcome your feedback regarding this change.
