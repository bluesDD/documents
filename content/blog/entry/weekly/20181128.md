Hello! Mackerel team CRE Miura (id:missasan:detail) here.

Only a few days left in November. How the time flies. The end of the year is finally upon us. Do you already have plans for this holiday season? Mackerel Drink Up will be held on December 11th (Tuesday). As we still have openings for the LT, if you or someone you know has some material to announce before the New Year, why not do so at Mackerel Drink Up?

Now on to this week’s update information.

## 【Advance release notice】Incompatible specification changes for the alert acquisition API

With the release on November 29th, 2018 (Thursday), a feature will be added to obtain closed alerts with the API, along with changes made to specifications incompatible with the alert acquisition API. Please see the blog post below for more details regarding the content of the changes etc.

## The problem of not being able to obtain disk metrics is now fixed with Linux kernel version 4.19 or later in mackerel-agent v 0.58.2

Update mackerel-agent to the latest version and give it a try.

## --connect-to option added to check-http

The `--connect-to` option added with this update is useful if you’d like to monitor whether the response being made when directly responding HTTPS with an HTTP application server or TLS terminal reverse proxy is being made with the correct certificate corresponding to the specified domain. Refer to the following link for usage options.

## Improvements made to mkr command in preparation for the release of API to obtain closed alerts

We’ve made some upgrades in order to be compatible with the scheduled release of the closed alert acquisition API as mentioned in the 【Advance release announcement】 above. If you’re running the alert API with mkr command, please consider updating with the latest release. The feature to obtain closed alerts (`--with-closed` option) will be available after the API feature release.
