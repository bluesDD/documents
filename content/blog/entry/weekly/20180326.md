Hello! Mackerel team CRE Inoue (id:a-know:detail) here.

I hope you all have had the chance to enjoy the cherry blossoms. I was thinking about going to relax in the park near my house this next weekend, but I'm a little worried they might all be gone by then...

Anyways, now on to this week’s update information.

## You can now change the number of display graph columns with keyboard shortcuts

The ability to change the number of display graph columns has been newly added to Mackerel keyboard shortcut feature. The shortcut cheat-sheet can be viewed by pressing `?` from the Mackerel screen.

You can increase the number of graph columns (each graph reduces in size) with the `[` key, and you can reduce the number of display graph columns (each graph is enlarged) with the `]` key. Be sure to try it out.

## MemAvailable can now be obtained as system metrics
With last week’s release of mackerel-agent v0.54.0, MemAvailable is now available for relatively new Linux users. A separate announcement regarding this was made last week.

Please check out the blog entry below for more details.
