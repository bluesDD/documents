Hello there! My name is Miura (id:missasan:detail) and I recently joined the Mackerel team as a CRE. 

It’s been just about a month since joining the company and this is my first update announcement. I think there will be plenty of opportunities to meet and greet at future events and through support contact. I’m looking forward to it!

Now on to this week’s update information.

## Upgrade option now available with mkr v0.28.0 release 

An upgrade option has been added to mkr command. With this option, file downloading will only be executed when the specified version of the plugin is not installed.

By adding the upgrade option as shown here `mkr plugin install --upgrade mackerelio/mackerel-plugin-sample@v0.0.2` and then installing, the following behavior will occur.

- If a plugin with the same release tag has already been installed, the installation process will finish without downloading.
- Only when the release tags differ, will the file be downloaded and the plugin binary placed.

Up until now, when running `mkr plugin install mackerelio/mackerel-plugin-sample@v0.0.2`, the file download would take place regardless of whether a plugin of the same release had already been installed or not. So, when using built-in provisioning tools like Ansible or Chef, the file would download every time, making them difficult to use. Now, with this week’s release of the upgrade option, it’s possible to download only the necessary files.

Additionally, you can also use the upgrade option to downgrade. For example, if v.0.0.2 is currently installed and v0.0.1 is then specified and executed, v0.0.1 will be installed.
