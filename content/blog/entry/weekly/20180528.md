Now on to this week’s update information.

## You can now delete selected metrics from graph definitions

You can now delete selected metrics from custom / service metric graph definitions in the host details. Metric series will be created again when a new metric is posted.

Try using this feature when clearing out unnecessary metrics in service metric graphs.

Here’s how to do it.

### Making changes from the graph definition list
Click [Settings] located next to the category [Custom Metrics].

Click [Edit] located next to each graph definition.
