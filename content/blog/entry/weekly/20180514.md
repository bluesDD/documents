Hello! Mackerel team CRE Miura (id:missasan:detail) here.

The Cloud Computing EXPO ran for 3 days last week. At the event, I got to meet and talk with a lot of new faces. Hopefully, some of them became fans of Mackerel! 
 
There were quite a few people already familiar with Mackerel there as well. I am very happy to note that when we asked the users what they thought about the service, most of them responded with comments like “It’s so easy to use!” and “The UI is great!”. What an encouragement!

Now on to this week’s update information.

## Titles can now be configured for graphboard graphs

An optional title can now be given when adding a graph to the [graphboard](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/howto/graphboard).

This feature will be particularly useful for those of you who use expression graphs and were having trouble displaying graph names. Definitely give it a try.


## The order of the array obtainable with the mkr monitors command is now standardized

As the title states, the order of the array obtainable with the `mkr monitors` command is now standardized.

Please note that if you have the `monitors.json` file, there may be differences in the initial `mkr pull` `mkr diff` command due to this update. These differences will be corrected after the initial attempt and onwards if the settings are the same.

## The IPv4 address is no longer displayed in the error message for URL external monitors

If an IPv4 address is included in an error message for URL external monitors, it is not displayed (masked) together with the port number.
