Hello, Mackerel Team Director Kasuya (id:daiksy:detail) here.

Here at Hatena, it wouldn’t feel like summer without our summer internship program. And this year’s new interns are fitting right in.

Starting this week, the student interns who’ve finished the first half lecture part of their internship have each been assigned to various teams and are trying their hands at feature development. 
I'm excited to see what features they’ll release this year.

By the way, here are features developed by the student interns who were assigned to the Mackerel team last year.

Anyways, here is this week’s update information.

## The namespace list can now be obtained with the metadata API

An API to obtain the namespace list of metadata registered to the host has been implemented in the metadata API.

Combining this with the metadata acquisition API makes it easier to manage the information registered to the host.

Check out the help page below for more information.

By the way, this is a feature implemented by this year's interns under the support of our development team! !

## Log levels have been changed for when metric posting fails in mackerel-agent

Up until now, if metric posting in mackerel-agent failed, it was output as an error in the agent's log. However, the failed posting would be retried and, unless the agent stopped, posted to Mackerel without losing any data.

For this reason, we’ve changed the log level to Warning.

Other updates for mackerel-agent and mackerel-agent-plugins are as follows.

### mackerel-agent 0.44.2

- Log levels changed for when when metric posting fails
- Linux/MIPS CPU/SoC model name is now displayed in host details 

### mackerel-agent-plugins 0.31.1

- [redis] the method to obtain queries metrics was corrected
- [plack] errors no longer occur when JSON parsing fails
- [jmx-jolokia] obtain metrics for Jmx Threading graph added
