Hello! Mackerel team CRE Miura (id:missasan:detail) here.

We’re already halfway through the month of April and the Mackerel team is gearing up for several upcoming events scheduled for May and June. Also, new giveaway items are in the works, so look forward to that!

Now on to this week’s update information.

## User-Agent can now be specified in the HTTP request header for external monitoring

An arbitrary User-Agent can now be specified in the HTTP request header configuration of external monitoring. If User-Agent is not specified or the value is left empty, `User-Agent: mackerel-http-checker/x.y.z` will be sent (`x.y.z` represents the version number).
