At the event, we received a lot of helpful comments, impressions, and requests from many different people. Some of them are even already moving quickly within the team. So keep your eye on Mackerel 2018!

Now on to this week’s update information.


## Specifications for the average value calculation method of metric monitoring have been adjusted

The other day, an advanced notice was published on this blog announcing the specification adjustment for the average value calculation method of metric monitoring. These adjustments were implemented with this week’s release.

With this release, average value monitoring is now done using the calculated value based on the number of metric postings. Now, even metrics posted at intervals of 5 minutes that were previously skipped, will be subject to correct average value monitoring.


## Notes can now be configured in check monitoring settings

```
[plugin.checks.ssh]
command = "ruby /path/to/check-ssh.rb"
memo = "This check monitor is ..."
```

As stated above, it is now possible to configure notes in the check monitoring settings of mackerel-agent. The character string specified here can be checked in alert notifications / the alert details screen / the host details page. Using these notes, you can inform the person receiving the alert about initial operations, monitoring meanings, as well as metric items that should be checked, etc. In order to use this feature, mackerel-agent needs to be updated to the latest version, v 0.52.0. 

## mackerel-agent now supported with Amazon Linux 2!
