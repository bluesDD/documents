Last week, we made an announcement regarding the termination of the “im.kayac” service ([https://mackerel.io/blog/entry/announcement/20171017:title]). And as scheduled, the feature became unavailable as a notification destination in Mackerel on October 26th.

The following operations are no longer available.

- Creating a new im.kayac channel in the “Channel Settings”
- Display of existing registered im.kayac channels is channel list
- Sending of notifications to existing registered im.kayac channels

For those of you who used im.kayac as a notification destination, please review the notification settings once again.

Anyways, here is this week’s update information.


## Arbitrary commands can now be invoked based on check monitoring results 
Check monitoring in Mackerel allows the user to monitor from various points of view, such monitoring text logs with `check-log` and monitoring processes with `check-procs`. With this week's update, it is now possible to execute commands based on those monitoring results.

In order to use this feature, you’ll need to add the `action` option to mackerel-agent.conf as shown below.

```
[plugin.checks.log]
command = "check-log -f /path/to/file -p PATTERN"
action = { command = "bash -c '[ \"$MACKEREL_STATUS\" != \"OK\" ]' && ruby /path/to/something.rb", user = "someone" }
```

In the environment variable `MACKEREL_STATUS`, the execution result (either `OK`, `WARNING`, `CRITICAL`, or `UNKNOWN`) of the immediately preceding `command` (not `action.command`) is set. In the above example, if the execution result of the previous check monitor is not `OK`, the command is invoked as the user specified in the `user` (configuration) field. 

There’s also an environment variable called `MACKEREL_PREVIOUS_STATUS` which sets the “execution result of the command before the previous command”, and this will allow you to flexibly automate operation, to some extent, based on check monitoring results. Check out the help page below for more details about this feature.

## Expressions no longer included in sentences of expression monitoring alert notifications
This is an [Experimental Feature](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/advanced/experimental-features-config) for [Expression Monitoring](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/expression-monitoring) in Mackerel, and with a monitor rule which uses this, long expressions will no longer be included in the contents of alert notifications.
