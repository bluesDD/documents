Hello! Mackerel team CRE Miura (id:missasan:detail) here.

This feature is the second of which was co-developed with iret Inc., following the recent release of our [DynamoDB integrated feature](https://mackerel.io/blog/entry/weekly/20180925)!

Billable targets are determined using the conversion 1 Distribution = 1 Host. Additionally, since CloudFront is a global service, integration with CloudFront is possible regardless of the region selected in the AWS integration settings.
