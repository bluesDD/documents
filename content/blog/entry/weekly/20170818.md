Up until the middle of this week, our support window took some time off for the summer holidays (except for emergencies), but they’re back at it now. Sorry for any inconvenience and we appreciate your cooperation. 

Anyways, here is this week’s update information.

## Member invitations can now be canceled with the API

Using the invitation API, you can invite members to an organization by specifying an email address, but with this week's update you can now cancel invitations with the API.

Up until now, it was only possible to cancel invitations from the Web UI, but now the same operation can be done from the API. You can also use it when you want to re-invite a member with different permissions. By all means, try it out.

For details regarding how to use the API, check out the help page below.

## Date and time of the latest update can now be obtained with the metadata API

Various information can be registered to the host using the metadata API, and now you can obtain the date and time of its latest update.

```
% curl --dump-header - https://mackerel.io/api/v0/hosts/<host_id>/metadata/<namespace> -H "X-Api-Key: <API_KEY>"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
