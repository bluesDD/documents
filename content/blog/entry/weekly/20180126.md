Mackerel users, thanks for waiting! The following large updates were made regarding metric retention with Mackerel.

- The Standard plan’s metric retention period has been extended to**【460 days】** (previously**【400 days】**).
- The period to check metrics of 1 min granularity is now**【460 days】** (previously**【25 hours】**)
    - Due to feature implementation timing, checking 1 min granularity metrics is only available for data after December 1st 2017.


I am very happy to be able to bring this update news to all of you. Now it’s even easier to check server load seasonality and apply capacity planning. Definitely give it a try!


Other updates follow below.

As you can see in the image above, it’s now possible to add an email address to receive mail related to "Payment" and "Support Team contact".

Up until now, "payment related email" was sent to users with owner authority and “emails exchanged with the Mackerel support team” were sent to the user who contacted the support team. Now, in addition to having mail sent to each user, you can have mail sent to an address of your specification.

This can be configured in the [Organization’s settings](https://mackerel.io/my?tab=setting).
