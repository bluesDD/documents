## Mackerel Drink Up #3 in the books!

[Mackerel Drink Up #3](https://mackerelio.connpass.com/event/46204/) was held the day before yesterday (Wed.).

Despite a few sudden cancellations due to the busy end-of-the-year season, the Mackerel team was able to have several meaningful conversations with those who were able to attend.
 
We didn’t announce the “Free Mackerel apparel present for all participants” when accepting applications, but once we did at the venue, everyone seemed ecstatic. 

We even held a Rock-Paper-Scissors tournament and the winner received a rare Mackerel hoodie!

That’s a wrap for this year’s official events, but fret not, we plan on making this a regular event next year too. Be sure not to miss out!

Anywho, here is this week’s update information. 

## mackerel-agent installation can now be done with a one-liner

Since Mackerel is a push type server monitoring service, installing agent software called “mackerel-agent” on the monitoring target server is required. 

With this week’s update, installing this mackerel-agent can now be performed with a one-liner!

You can check from the [new host registration instruction page](https://mackerel.io/my/instruction-agent).

Even until now, what has been praised as “easy to install” has become even easier. 

The following will automatically be performed when you run this command.

* Repository registration
* mackerel-agent download
* Initial configurations（API key configuration）
* mackerel-agent startup 

By clicking “Otherwise register a new host step by step” located on the instruction page, you can also check the procedure that has been used up until now. If you’re interested, try this out as well.
