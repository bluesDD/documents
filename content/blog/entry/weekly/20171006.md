Thanks to all of you, the event was a huge success that showcased great presentations from a handful of wonderful speakers. We would like to sincerely thank all the presenters and everyone who attended the event. We will soon be posting a separate report on this blog with details from the event. 

Anyways, here is this week’s update information.

## mackerel-agent has been updated with countermeasures for .io domain malfunctions

In the blog entry linked below, we made an announcement regarding the .io domain malfunction and the corresponding measures taken by Mackerel. However, this week we have updated mackerel-agent with permanent countermeasures.

Specifically, the API request destination from the agent to Mackerel has been changed from Mackerel.io to **api.mackerelio.com**. In response to this, the temporary countermeasures taken, such as changing the connectivity monitoring judgment interval, will be returned to its’ original state in sequential order.

To all of the mackerel-agent users out there, please update the agent or add the description `apibase = "https://api.mackerelio.com/"`  to the top line of the configuration file and restart the agent (excluding KCPS version Mackerel).

As a settings option for the notification channels OpsGenie and PagerDuty, it is now possible to specify whether or not alerts of OpsGenie/PagerDuty will close according to alerts closing in Mackerel. Try using it in accordance with your team’s incident management style.


## Notification channels with improper destinations can now be suspended

Notification channels will now be automatically suspended if they fail a certain number of times for reasons such as having an invalid URL configured or if the the notification destination URL was accidentally deleted etc.  While suspended, the channel will be displayed as shown below in the notification channel list.
