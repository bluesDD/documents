Hello! Mackerel sales engineer Inoue (id:a-know:detail) here.

Yesterday, a lot of Mackerel users came to Microsoft’s lovely venue and joined us for [the 10th Mackerel Meetup](https://mackerelio.connpass.com/event/54302/)!

We started off the event with Mackerel producer Sugiyama (id:sugiyama88:detail) talking about "Microsoft Azure Integration" and "Improving Windows support". After that, MTI presenters talked about “Key points to monitoring Azure infrastructure with Mackerel” and presenters from Future Architect talked about “Vulnerability detection tools・Vuls and Mackerel integration concepts”. We also ran 5 lightning talks! Hopefully, everyone who attended the event was able to come away with something.

A huge shout-out to Microsoft for sharing such a great venue, to the presenters, and to all of our users who attended! The entire Mackerel team thanks you.

Keep your eyes open for the Mackerel Meetup #10 event report in a separate blog coming soon!

Anyways, here is this week’s update information.

## Addition of uWSGI vassal plugin
[mackerel-agent-plugins 0.27.0](https://github.com/mackerelio/mackerel-agent-plugins/releases/tag/v0.27.0) was released and the uWSGI vassal plugin has been added.

By using this plugin, metrics from the uWSGi server ran application (vassal) can easily be obtained with Mackerel. Yesterday, Hatena web operation engineer and the developer of this plugin id:kizkoh:detail even made an announcement about it at the Mackerel Meetup.

## Mackerel booth at the Spring Cloud Computing EXPO 

Mackerel is scheduled to run a booth at the "Cloud Computing EXPO · Spring" to be held from Wednesday, May 10th through Friday the 12th!

I’ll be in the booth all three days, so if you’d like to talk about Mackerel or if you’re interested in hearing about what went down at the Meetup, by all means, stop on by!

## Our next update blog will be on Friday, May 12th

Well, Golden Week (a Japanese holiday) is finally here. The Mackerel development team will be taking next week off, but I’m sure some people will be taking as much as 9 days off for some well deserved vacation. 

Our next update announcement is scheduled for Friday, May 12th. Thank you for choosing Mackerel.
