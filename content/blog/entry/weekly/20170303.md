Hey! I can’t believe it’s already March.

In the Kanto region, our first spring storm was on February 17th and I thought that maybe the weather would gradually start to get warmer from there… but I’ve still been wearing my scarf everyday.

Lately, some members of the Mackerel team seem like they can’t stop sneezing and I assumed that they had caught a cold, but it turns out that pollen allergies have started to flare up and they are making people miserable. 

Anyways, here is this week’s update information.

## AWS Integration now supports Lambda

The highly requested Lambda integration feature has been released.

Please note that, in order to use Lambda integration, you must first grant the `AWSLambdaReadOnlyAccess` policy to the Integration IAM role.

When integrating with Mackerel, 1 Lambda function is treated as 1 host. Additionally, since tags do not exist in Lambda, narrowing down integration targets is not currently supported. We will consider looking for some way to narrow down Lambda hosts and review the specifications.

For more information on configuration methods, obtainable metrics, and more, check out the following help pages.

## JAWS DAYS 2017 Lunchtime presentation

We mentioned this last week as well, but Mackerel will be participating as a sponsor at [JAWS DAYS 2017](http://jawsdays2017.jaws-ug.jp/) on March 11th (Saturday) and sales engineer id:Soudai:detail will be giving a presentation during the A-track lunchtime session.

The presentation is scheduled to begin at 12:15 p.m. ([Time table](http://jawsdays2017.jaws-ug.jp/timetable/)). We will probably talk about the setup with AWS and some pretty interesting combinations with Mackerel. So look forward to it!
