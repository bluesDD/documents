Mackerel team CRE Miura (id:missasan:detail) here. 

The other day, we released an entry announcing the Mackerel Ambassador Program. The eye-catching image used in that announcement was actually created by id:mazco:detail who recently joined the Mackerel team as a designer. We wanted an image that captured a feeling of celebration for the start of the new program. id:mazco really delivered and made this bright and cute design that resembles a popping party cracker. We’re really looking forward to all the new Mackerel designs, not only with media-related designs like these, but also for the UI/UX, novelty gifts, and more.

## Issue fix for Japanese character corruption during plugin execution with Windows

The issue of Japanese character corruption during plugin execution for Windows was fixed with the release of mackerel-agent v0.59.0.

## check-disk plugin now supported in Windows environments

Up until now, an inode check was always performed with the check-disk plugin even if only the `-w / -c` option was specified. Because of this, the plugin was not compatible in Windows environments where inodes do not exist. With the release of go-check-plugins v0.27.0, checking for inodes can be skipped when only the `-w / -c` option is specified. With this, the check-disk plugin is now also available in Windows environments.

In addition to this, with the release of mackerel-agent v0.59.0, the check-disk plugin is now also included in the mackerel-agent installer for Windows.

## evicted_keys added to mackerel-plugin-redis metrics

With the release of mackerel-agent-plugins v0.54.0, evicted_keys has been added to the metrics of mackerel-plugin-redis.
