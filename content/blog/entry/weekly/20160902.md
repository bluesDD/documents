Hey! Mackerel sales engineer, id:a-know here.

[Hatena Engineer Seminar #6 (infrastructure-focused)](http://developer.hatenastaff.com/entry/2016/08/10/160711) was held the day before yesterday, on August 31st. I also had the pleasure of taking the stage. After the event, I was approached by Mackerel users and others interested and was able to talk about Mackerel and about being a sales engineer.

The get-together after the event was so fun it was over before I knew it. In the future, I’d like to create more opportunities to meet with all of you in a variety of ways.

Anyways, here is this week’s release information.

## GCE Instance information can now be displayed

The display of GCE (Google Compute Engine) Instance Information is now supported in the host detail screen and host list screen. And since the display of GCP’s Project ID is also supported, situations such as managing GCE instances across multiple projects in Mackerel becomes more convenient.

By the way, the Mackerel interns that I told you about last week were in charge of developing this feature. With one week left in the internship, I’m looking forward to next week’s release as well.

## Participants wanted for the Second Mackerel Hands-On Seminar!
