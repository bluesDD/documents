It looks like it might rain here in Tokyo today. Recently, it seems like we’ve been getting a lot of rain and it makes me wonder if the rainy season is already upon us. That’s probably just down toward Okinawa though. I guess I’m a little impatient.


Anyways, here is this week’s update information.


## The period an API key has not been in use is now displayed
In Mackerel, you can create API keys in addition to the default API key. It is also possible to create read-only keys which are really useful. On the other hand, there have been issues where keys that aren't being used get left-over or keys that are actually being used are accidentally deleted.
 
With this update, the period an API key hasn't been in use will be displayed for each key.

The time is displayed below the API key string.  Time periods of less than two days will not be displayed. 

Hopefully this will make it easier to manage API keys.

## 【Notice】Mackerel booth at AWS Summit Tokyo 2017
We made this announcement last week, but Mackerel is set to run a booth next week at AWS Summit Tokyo 2017.

We’re scheduled to attend the event from Wednesday, May 31st to Friday, June 2nd. New members of the sales team will be there along with Mackerel application engineers. 

I hope many of you can make it!
