Today is Tanabata, a day celebrated on July 7th here in Japan. Also referred to as the Star Festival, children and adults hang written wishes on bamboo branches and look up to the stars in hopes that their wish comes true. It might be good to look up at the night sky this evening and make a wish.

Also, a typhoon hit islands off the coast of Japan this week. Looks like we’re about to enter typhoon season, so everyone stay safe!

Anyways, here is this week’s update information.
