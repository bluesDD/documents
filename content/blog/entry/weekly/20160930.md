We had the opportunity to make a variety of announcements concerning Mackerel, including the introduction of recently released features. A big thanks to everyone who attended and to all of those who made the event possible.

Well then, here is this week’s release information.

## Mackerel alert notifications now support “LINE Notify”

[LINE DEVELOPER DAY 2016](http://linedevday.linecorp.com/jp/2016/) was held yesterday, September 29th. Those who attended the event may have heard the announcement already, but Mackerel is now supported as an initial cooperative of “LINE Notify”, the notification service connecting LINE and other external applications.
