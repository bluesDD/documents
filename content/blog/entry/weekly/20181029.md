Hello! Mackerel team CRE Miura (id:missasan:detail) here.

We recently released a new [case study featuring SEGA Games](https://mackerel.io/ja/blog/entry/customers/segagames) and their use of Mackerel in social network gaming environments. This article goes over the introduction of Mackerel motivated by transitioning to the cloud and how it’s used in daily operation. Be sure to check it out!

Now on to this week’s update information.

## A new feature has been added to display maintenance and incident information from the management screen

When Mackerel is under maintenance or if an incident has occurred, a message will now be displayed at the top of the screen as shown in the below images.

#### During maintenance

Now it’s possible to see information from Mackerel’s status page in a more convenient way. Use this to eliminate false alarms. For more detailed information, continue to check the [status page](https://status.mackerel.io/) and follow our [official Twitter](https://twitter.com/mackerelio) timeline.

## A plugin name can now be set to User-Agent for plugins that send http requests

For plugins that send http requests, a plugin name such as `mackerel-plugin-plack`  can now be set to the User-Agent at the time of request. Up until now, the standard User-Agent of Go was used.

Now, we can easily distinguish where the request was issued with User-Agent when viewing the access log. Please be cautious when using User-Agent for access restrictions etc.
