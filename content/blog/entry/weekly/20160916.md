Yesterday Mackerel ran a booth for business day at the Tokyo Game Show.

A big thanks to all the people that stopped by!  The exhibit will be held on 9/15 (Thursday) and 9/16 (Friday), Business day only.

Here is this week’s update.

## You can now edit an existing AWS Integration access key

Until now, in order to change an existing access key in AWS Integration, you had to delete the configuration and re-create a new one.

With this update, you can now change the access key as well when editing.
