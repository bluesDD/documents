Hello. Development team director id:daiksy:detail here.

Recently, I opened my window before bed expecting a warm night, but was surprised by a very chilly morning. This kind of weather makes controlling my physical condition pretty difficult. Is everyone out there staying healthy? 

Here is this week’s update.

## “Critical alerts only” now possible for notification groups

For some time we’ve been receiving requests to be able to change notification destinations and to have only urgent Critical alerts be sent to chats when notifications of monitoring results are made.

In this week's release, we added the item "notification level" to the notification group’s setting screen. When the `Critical only` is toggled on, alerts to the notification group will only be sent under the following conditions and Warning alerts will not be sent.

- Notifications will be sent for error levels of Critical or higher (Critical, Unknown)
- OK notifications will be sent for alerts that have previously exceeded Critical
 
By combining notification groups with limited notification levels, notification destinations can flexibly be set according to the notification level.
