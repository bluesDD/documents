Hello! Mackerel team CRE Miura (id:missasan:detail) here.

Today is the last day of the 2018 Hatena Summer Internship program. This month went by so fast!

For the second half of the program, the student interns are assigned to each team and work on task assignments and feature developments that will actually be incorporated into the service. Two student interns were also assigned to the Mackerel team and were challenged with a lot of issues.

The feature that was introduced last Monday (9/3) titled "Roles can now be registered/deleted from the API" was implemented and released by our two student interns.

Since it’s the last day of the summer internship, we are going to introduce a complete set of the features implemented by our student interns.

Here is a message from Mackerel team director Katsuya (id:daiksy:detail) who helped mentor the student interns over this last month.

> This is the fourth year that the Mackerel team has received student interns. 
> And the speed of development has been outstanding this year. On more than one occasion, I was surprised checking GitHub after a meeting like, "What!? This feature is already up for review ??".
> 
> After two weeks of development, today is the last day of this year’s internship. 
> I think that this was a good experience for the student interns, but they also inspired the team as well. It was a very fulfilling two weeks.

It truly was a surprise that so many new features were developed and released in such a short period of time.

Now on to the update information.

## An Organizations list screen has been added

View a list of the organizations that you belong to by accessing the URL below.

https://mackerel.io/orgs/

You can also access the same screen by clicking [▼] next to the [Organization Name] on the left side menu and clicking [Organizations].

From this page you can see the number of services, hosts, members, and alerts that are currently occurring for each organization. If you belong to multiple organizations, you can use this list to see the whole picture, like when confirming for which organization an alert is occurring.

## API added to post metadata for Services/Roles

Up until now, you could register metadata to hosts, but with this release, you can now register arbitrary JSON data as metadata for services/roles. For more details, refer to the [Mackerel API document for Metadata](https://mackerel.io/api-docs/entry/metadata).

## API added to obtain monitor settings by specifying an ID

We’ve added an API that allows you to specify the target monitor setting ID and obtain settings information. The specification method is `/api/v0/monitors/<monitorId>`.

For more details, refer to the the [Mackerel API document on Monitors](https://mackerel.io/api-docs/entry/monitors).

## API added to register/delete notification channels

This API is currently only supported for email notifications and Slack. With this release, information that can be obtained with the notification channel list API can now be obtained in more detail with email notifications and Slack.

For more information, refer to the [Mackerel API document on Notification Channels](https://mackerel.io/ja/api-docs/entry/channels).

## Multiple services can now be selected by filtering the Alerts list screen

It is now possible to specify multiple services with OR conditions when filtering displayed alerts in the [Alerts list screen](https://mackerel.io/my/alerts).

## Multiple services can now be selected by filtering the Hosts list screen

As with the Alerts list, it is now possible to specify multiple services with OR when filtering the display in the [Hosts list screen](https://mackerel.io/my/hosts).
