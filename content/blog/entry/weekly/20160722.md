id:Songmu, the director of Mackerel’s development team, is taking the stage under the title "Mackerel technology. Where we’ve come from and where we’re going." at [JTF2016](http://2016.techfesta.jp/), held on Sunday, July 24th. (Unfortunately, the event page is only provided in Japanese.)

We’ll be running a booth on that day so, by all means, stop by for a visit!

Here is this week’s update.

## You can now configure members to be view-only

It is now possible to configure members to be view-only for each screen of Mackerel from the organization’s member settings ([https://mackerel.io/my?tab=members](https://mackerel.io/my?tab=members)).

The switch can be made by pressing the "change permission" button.

Currently, this operation is only possible for users who are already members. However, we are planning for feature expansion such as being able to invite view-only members from the beginning. 

## New member id:a-know has joined us!
