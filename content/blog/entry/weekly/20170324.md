Hello! Sales engineer id:Soudai:detail here.

The cherry blossoms have started to bloom a little early and it’s finally starting to feel like spring.

[https://mackerelio.connpass.com/event/52433/:title] was held last week and a lot of people attended the event. We were able to exchange ideas on topics like plugin implementation and even had an LT tournament, all while enjoying a really fun atmosphere. 

Here’s a report blog written by a participant.

I also participated in the LT tournament. Take a look at this as well.

If you were too busy and couldn’t make it this time, don’t worry! We’ll be holding these types of events regularly in the future. So by all means, join us next time!!

Anyways, here is this week’s update information.

## Memos can now be be left for monitoring rules using mkr commands 

Last week we released a feature that lets you leave notes for monitoring rules. Now, this feature is also supported by mkr. As before, by simply adding the memo item, this feature is easy to use when updating with `mkr monitors`.

### Example use

```diff
% mkr monitors diff
 {
   "critical": 2000,
   "duration": 1,
   "metric": "hoge.count",
   "name": "mackerel-demo - hoge.count",
+  "memo": "test"
   "operator": ">",
   "service": "mackerel-demo",
   "type": "service",
   "warning": 1000
 },

% mkr monitors push

```

- For those who are interested in, but do not have experience with server monitoring or monitoring related work
