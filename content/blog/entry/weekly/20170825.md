Hello! Mackerel team’s CRE Inoue (id:a-know:detail) here.

Last Saturday, Mackerel successfully held its’ first Hackathon event, [Mackerel Plugin Hackathon #1](https://mackerelio.connpass.com/event/63087/). 

Anyways, here is this week’s update information.

## A new feature, “GraphBoards” has been released!

With this update, we’ve released a new feature called “GraphBoards”!

So what does this feature do?

This feature is like dashboards, you can select any role graph or service metrics graph of that service and freely rearrange the layout. It’s ideal for users who have numerous roles or are using a lot of service metrics.

It’s also possible to create a more intuitive layout just by dragging and dropping!

Use of the automatic update feature and switching between display intervals is possible for any of the arranged graphs without having to change to another screen.

## Notes attached to monitoring rules are now included in the body of mail notifications

For monitoring rules created in Mackerel, you can leave notes such as “If this alert goes off, check ------ first” or “If ----- or ------ occurs, this alert will occur”.

Display for the content of these notes in alert notifications is already supported with some channels such as Slack and HipChat, but with this update, the note content is now also included in the body of mail notifications. We believe that this will help make troubleshooting smoother than before.
