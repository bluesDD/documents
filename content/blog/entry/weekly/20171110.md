Yesterday, we issued a press release as a company announcing the release of a new feature for cloud providers, "Cloud Provider Integration".

As the first step in providing this "Cloud Provider integration" feature, we also announced our collaboration with “BIGLOBE Cloud Hosting”, the public cloud of BIGLOBE Co., Ltd.

By developing such features, we hope to be a valuable resource to even more server administrators.

Now onto this week’s update content.

## Plugin installer feature added to the mkr・CLI tool
A plugin installer feature has been added to [Mackerel’s mkr CLI tool](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/advanced/cli).

Simply put, this "feature makes it easier to install plugins other than official plugin repositories". 

All official plugins are developed with Golang, however plugins supported in the plugin installer can use any development language. Mackerel has an [official plugin registry](https://github.com/mackerelio/plugin-registry), so be sure register your created plugin here!

Sometime next week, we plan on releasing a separate entry about this plugin installer and how to use, so stay tuned!

## The Mackerel advent calendar!
