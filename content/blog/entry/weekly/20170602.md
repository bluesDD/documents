Hello! Sales engineer id:a-know:detail here.

Right now, Mackerel is busy running a booth at [AWS Summit Tokyo 2017](http://www.awssummit.tokyo/)! Today is the last day, but we’ve already received so many visitors over the these past two days. Thank you all so very much!

Only a few hours left, but I want to tell as many people as possible about Mackerel!

Anyways, here is this week’s update information.


## Lambda function integration targets can now be narrowed down with tags in AWS Integration

You might recall the [recent support of tags being made the other day for AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/jp/about-aws/whats-new/2017/04/aws-lambda-supports-tagging-and-cost-allocations/), but now, Lambda function hosts to be registered can be narrowed down with tags in Mackerel as well.

## Mackerel support staff to present at Customer Success Event
Here’s a little something just before the event. I, Inoue, also in charge of Mackerel's customer support, will be presenting at the “[Customer Success Event vol.3](https://csnight.connpass.com/event/57622/)” to be held on Monday, June 5th at the office of Good Patch Co., Ltd.

The theme for this event is "Customer Success for Engineer targeted SaaS". And although I’m technically a "sales engineer", I am constantly thinking about how to make day-to-day server management more efficient with Mackerel while interacting with customers. I believe that this way of thinking has something to say about customer success, and I hope to talk a little bit about it at the event. For those interested, by all means, come join us.
