Hello! Mackerel sales engineer Inoue (id:a-know:detail) here. 

The other day we made an announcement on this blog about maintenance scheduled for early August.

Unlike normal maintenance, this is in preparation for Mackerel’s growth further down the road. We will put forth maximum effort in order to keep the maintenance’s impact to a minimum, but users may still be affected so we’re letting you know in advance. Please take a moment to read the entry above.

Anyways, here is this week’s update information.

## Azure Integration now supports Redis Cache

We’ve already expanded support for [Azure Integration](https://mackerel.io/blog/entry/weekly/20170623) which was just released at the end of last month. Following SQL database, this time we’ve expanded support for [Redis Cache](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cache/).

Right now I think it’s fairly popular to configure a caching mechanism using Redis as part of the system. Even if Redis cache is configured by Azure, it’s possible to collect those metrics in Mackerel. By all means, give it a try.
