Hello! December is already upon us, leaving just one more month left of 2016. How are everyone’s holiday plans coming along? 

Well then, here is this week’s update information.

## IP address range restrictions can now be made for Web screen and API access

Mackerel is consistently reinforcing security features such as the support of view-only users, and now, restrictions can be done by IP addresses!

This configuration is available for each organization. Check out the organization’s [“Settings”](https://mackerel.io/my?tab=setting) tab!
