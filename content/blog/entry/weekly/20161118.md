Hello! Mackerel sales engineer, id:a-know here. 

I am pleased to say that the number of people using Mackerel is increasing by the day, and with it, all kinds of knowledge is being shared in the form of blog entries. <b>Thank you very much!</b>

Here is one from this week! (Unfortunately, it’s only available in Japanese)

This blog entry introduces 5 tools with the hopes of promoting IT. And Mackerel is one of them!

Here at Mackerel, we pride ourselves on being a service that is simple to setup, easy to use, intuitive, and yet equipped with profound UI/UX. Thank you for writing this article [Cork](http://corkagency.com/)!

We plan on introducing more user blog entries like this periodically in the future, so keep up the good work!

Anywho, here is this week’s update information.

## Custom request headers for URL external monitoring can now be specified with the API

A custom request header can now be specified with the API for the URL external monitoring feature available with Mackerel’s Standard plan.

As a server monitoring service that “excites engineers”, being programmable is just one important aspect. On top of that, we’ve gathered all kinds of API. By all means, give it a try!

## The capacity for the Mackerel x Twilio Hands-On Seminar has been increased!

We announced the [Mackerel x Twilio Hands-On Seminar](http://mackerelio.connpass.com/event/44324/) here last week, but we’ve already received applications past the 20 person capacity!

[http://mackerelio.connpass.com/event/44324/:title]

We’ve made adjustments and increased the capacity number from <b>20 to 30 people!</b>

Even with the adjustment we still might go over capacity, but your chances of being selected has gone way up. So by all means, apply!
