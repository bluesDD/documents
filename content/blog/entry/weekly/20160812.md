Hello! Mackerel sales engineer, id:a-know here. This is my first blog entry for Mackerel!

Yesterday was the first annual Mountain day. How did everyone enjoy the national holiday? I decided to work on a hobby of mine and before I knew it… the day was over. 

It looks like quite a few people took today off as well in order to have a nice long weekend! To all you on vacation and even those of you still stuck at the office, be careful in this heat and have a great weekend! 

## 2-step authentication when logging in is now possible

You can now enable 2-step authentication for your Mackerel account. With this, you can configure an authentication code obtained from your device, in addition to your username and password, to be required when signing-in.

Configuration can be done from the screen after logging in to Mackerel, or from “Account settings” located at the top right-hand side of the user menu. 

For a more detailed explanation, please refer to the help page below.
