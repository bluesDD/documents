Only 2 more weeks until our 200th week of consecutive releases!

Hello! Mackerel team CRE Miura (id:missasan:detail) here.

Here is this week’s update information.

## You can now specify a list of email address domains for sending invitations

It is now possible to set a whitelist of email address domains to send member invitations from the Organization’s Settings screen ([https://mackerel.io/my?tab=setting]). When publishing within the company, or only with a specific partnering company etc., you can prevent the accidental invitation of unwanted users by setting domain restrictions.

## ServiceName can now be specified in mackerel-plugin-aws-ecs

Prior to this week’s release, you could specify the `ClusterName` to obtain metrics. Now in addition to this, you can also specify the `ServiceName` as well.

With this, it’s now possible to obtain metrics based on the service even in environments using Fargate.

Additionally, you can also obtain the number of RUNNING tasks by specifying this option.

## End of Debian 7 support

Accompanying the end of LTS support for Debian 7 on May 31, 2018, Mackerel will no longer be supported with Debian 7.

With this, we can no longer guarantee operation in Debian 7 environments in the future. In addition, we will no longer be offering support for inquiries concerning environments using mackerel-agent in Debian 7.

We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your understanding.

For more on Mackerel / mackerel-agent supported environments, please refer to the following page.
