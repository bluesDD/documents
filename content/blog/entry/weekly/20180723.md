Hello! Mackerel team CRE Miura (id:missasan:detail) here.

The other day, fellow CRE Inoue (id:a-know:detail) presented at an event called Support Engineer Night vol.3. His presentation introduced technologically challenging cases unique to server monitoring services, and gave a glimpse of the other side of Mackerel support.
