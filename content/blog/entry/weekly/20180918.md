Hello! Mackerel team CRE Miura (id:missasan:detail) here.

ISUCON8 was held last weekend and Mackerel team members Matsuki  (id:Songmu:detail) and Shibasaki（id:id:shiba_yu36:detail) both made it through the qualifying round. I’m looking forward to the main event.

Now on to the latest update information.

## loadavg1 and loadavg15 added to system metrics

With the release of mackerel-agent v0.57.0, `loadavg1` and `loadavg15` have been added to the loadavg graph which previously only supported `loadavg5`. Now you can conveniently compare `loadavg5` and `loadavg15` to check whether the CPU load is increasing or decreasing. When updating mackerel-agent to the latest version, two system metric items will be added to the target host.

This update is compatible with all platforms except Windows Server.

## The log rotation tracking accuracy for check-log plugin has been improved

With the release of go-check-plugins v0.22.1, a change was made to the inode number for when tracking log files with the check-log plugin. With this, the tracking accuracy for log files when logs are rotated has improved.

## You can now specify the number of redirects with check-http

With the release of go-check-plugins v0.22.1, you can now specify the number of follow up redirects with the option `--max-redirects` (the default is `10`).

Thank you for your contributions!

## Null values changed to 0 for AWS ALB/ELB RequestCount metrics

In environments where ALB / ELB metrics are obtained with the AWS Integration feature, a change was made to now post 0 if the RequestCount metric value obtained from CloudWatch is null. This fixes the problem of alerts not closing automatically, which was previously caused by the null value.

## Code signing certificate for Windows Server installer updated

With the release of mackerel-agent v 0.57.0, the code signing certificate for Windows Server installer has been updated. Please note that if you use the previous version of the installer, a certificate expiration warning will occur.
