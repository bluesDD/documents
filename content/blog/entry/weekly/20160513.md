## AWS Integration has been released

Obtain metrics of AWS cloud products in Mackerel with the newly released AWS Integration.

Currently, ELB and RDS are available.

Each AWS cloud product will be registered as one host in Mackerel and therefore be counted as a billable host. Additionally, the API of AWS will be called every 5 minutes for each targeted metric to be obtained. Please take note, for this reason, an [Amazon CloudWatch API usage fee](https://aws.amazon.com/jp/cloudwatch/pricing/) may occur.

In Mackerel, active hosts will be billed. Therefore, in order to remove a host registered in AWS integration from the billing target, delete the AWS Integration’s configuration. The host will become inactive and no longer a billable target. 

Obtained metrics are treated the same as host metrics obtained by the agent and monitors can also be configured the same way. 

For more information check out the help page.
