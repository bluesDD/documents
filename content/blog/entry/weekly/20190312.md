Hello! Mackerel Team CRE  id:a-know:detail here.

The weather has warmed up considerably and I’m beginning to see some cherry blossoms popping up here and there on my commute to work. Anyways, on to this week's release contents.

## Release of mkr v0.35.1 

With the release of version `0.35.1` for Mackerel’s command line tool [mkr](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/advanced/cli), the following bug contained in version ` 0.35.0` has been fixed.

- The specification content for the `hosts` subcommand --status option not being applied.

Just to be safe, we recommend checking what is installed on your PC and the version of mkr being used with regularly run scripts.
