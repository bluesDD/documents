Production has finally finished for the Mackerel glass, one of the gifts for the 2017 New Year campaign! We started shipping the other day so hopefully one will find its way to you soon. 

If you’re selected, be sure to tweet with the hashtag [#mackerelio](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mackerelio)!

We may be giving out more presents at Meetup and other official events in the future. You definitely don’t want to miss out!
Anyways, here is this week’s update information.

## You can now leave notes for monitoring rules

You can now leave notes for each monitoring rule set in Mackerel.

## Mackerel Drink Up #4 Tokyo!

Mackerel Drink Up is mainly a chance for our Mackerel users to come hang out at the Hatena Tokyo office, eat, drink, and talk about all sorts of things. The 4th Mackerel Drink Up will be held on Wednesday, March 22nd!

This event is perfect for those of you who are curious to see how other users are using Mackerel or if you would like to speak to the Mackerel staff directly.
Those who wish to attend will be chosen by lottery due to the limited number of spots, but there are still plenty available, so by all means, apply!
