Hello! Mackerel team CRE Miura (id:missasan:detail) here.

Mackerel will be attending Cloud Impact 2018 which is scheduled to run from October 17th (Wednesday) through October 19th (Friday) at Tokyo Big Sight. Be sure to stop by the Mackerel booth!

Now on to this week’s update information.

## Check monitoring plugin for AWS CloudWatch Logs added

The mackerel-check-plugins package has been updated to v0.23.0. With this update, we’ve added `check-aws-cloudwatch-logs`,  a check plugin for AWS CloudWatch Logs! For more details such as on how to use, check out the help page below.

[https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/howto/check/aws-cloudwatch-logs:embed:cite]

Listed below are some additional notes about the plugin.

- Depending on the log flow rate of the log group specified by the `log-group-name`, check processing may time out.
    - As described in [https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/custom-checks:title], Mackerel's check monitoring default timeout setting is 30 seconds.
    - Change the timeout setting with `check_interval` or consider splitting the group if possible.
- Depending on usage, a CloudWatch API usage fee may occur.
    - Applicable to “Logs (Stored)” in [https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/:title].

If you have any points of concern, be sure to submit an issue / pull request to [the official Github repository](https://github.com/mackerelio/go-check-plugins) or contact [our support team](mailto:support@mackerel.io)!
