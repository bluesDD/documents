Hello! Mackerel team CRE Miura (id:missasan:detail) here.

Since the end of the rainy season, the heat has been relentless. Everyone please be sure to take good care and avoid heat stroke.

Now on to the update information.

## mkr v0.31.1 Docker Image release

Access the Docker Image [here](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/mackerel/mkr/). In the future, we plan to provide a new Docker image for each mkr command update. Use it to build development environments and to simplify and optimize version control.

## Mackerel Meetup #12 on August 2nd (Thurs.)ÔºÅ

Mackerel Meetup # 12 will be held on Thursday, August 2nd! This time, Drecom was nice enough to let us use their seminar room for the venue. 

At the event, user sessions will be held by two guests and the Mackerel team will present on the latest developments and the soon to be released anomaly detection feature.

Come and help us celebrate our achievement of 200 consecutive weeks of releases at this event!
