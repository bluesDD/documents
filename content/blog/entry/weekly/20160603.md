Today marks the third and final day of the AWS summit. 

We’ve been running a booth in the DemoPit for Developers and have received visits from numerous people so far.

We hope to see you out there today.

Here is this week’s Mackerel update.

## Test notifications can now be sent to notification groups

A test notification can now be sent to the notification group from the [channel’s configuration screen](https://mackerel.io/my/channels) .

By clicking the test button, a test transmission is sent out to all channels configured in the notification group. 

As a result, it has now become easier to check the notification group’s settings.
