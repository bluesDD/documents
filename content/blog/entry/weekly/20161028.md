It’s almost Halloween!

Here at Hatena, we’re having a Halloween TGIF on the last Friday of October. 

On this day, some staff members will even spend the day dressed up in costume.

Take a peek into the conference room and you might see a few monsters sitting down to a serious meeting... It’s a really fun day.  

Here is this week’s update.

## Retired hosts’ date and time of retirement to be displayed in host details

The date and time of retirement is now displayed in the host's details of the retired host.

This can be used in host management for investigating hosts that were unintentionally retired. 

## Individual graphs are now deleted when deleting a graph from the host details screen

Graphs in the host details can be deleted from the configuration screen accessed from the gear icon located on every custom graph. Before this, the delete function was specified to remove the entire organization’s graph definition and was not able to delete a specific graph of a specific host.

With this update, deleting a graph will only delete the graph displayed, making the operation more intuitive. 

If you would like to delete a graph from the entire organization as before, delete the graph definition from [https://mackerel.io/my/graph-defs](https://mackerel.io/my/graph-defs).

### mackerel-agent 0.37.0

#### The problem of not being able to obtain interface metrics with some environments of Windows has been resolved

Since the metric name has changed when the method of obtaining was modified, if you were able to obtain the interface in previous versions, please note that metrics might be collected as different metrics when the version is updated.

### mkr 0.12.0

#### A `custom` prefix has been added when posting metrics from mkr

A `custom` prefix has been added when posting host metrics from mkr, to match the behavior of the agent.

- There will be changes in graphs after upgrading if custom. prefix were not being sent
