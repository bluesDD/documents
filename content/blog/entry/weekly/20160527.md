We will be running an exhibit at the AWS Summit for three days starting on June 1st. 

Those attending the event should definitely stop by the Mackerel booth. 

Here is this week’s Mackerel update.

## AWS Integration now supports ElastiCache

ElastiCache metrics can now be collected in AWS Integration.

ElastiCache is converted as one host for each Cache Node.

When using this integration with ElastiCache, be sure to allow the AmazonElastiCacheReadOnlyAccess policy.

Check out the help page for more on how to configure etc.

We plan to expand the number of supported services in AWS Integration.

## mackerel.io now supports HTTP/2 

We weren’t able to inform you in last week’s announcement, but https://mackerel.io now supports HTTP/2.

Mackerel has supported SPDY since last year, however, accompanying the end of Chrome support, has advanced to support HTTP/2. 

As a result, we expect improvements in performance when referring to any page of mackerel.io in a HTTP/2 supported browser. 

In Mackerel, we continually strive for technical advancement and performance improvements. 

## New releases for mackerel-agent  etc.

New releases have been made for mackerel-agent, mackerel-agent-plugins, and mkr.

The contents of the update are listed below.

### mackerel-agent 0.31.1 
- By designating custom_identifier in the plugin settings, you can now post obtained metrics as metrics from a separate host.This is very effective when combined with AWS integration.
- Stability improvements

### mackerel-agent-plugins 0.20.1
- Minor modifications (such as refactoring)

### mkr 0.10.1
- Minor modifications (such as refactoring)）
