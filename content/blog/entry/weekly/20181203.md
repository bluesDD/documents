Hello! Mackerel team CRE Miura (id:missasan:detail) here. 

Now into December, advent calendars have started all over the place. Various campaigns and sales wars that are custom during this time of the year are also happening. And depending on your operational service, this may have an effect on your system or server status. Since Mackerel retains metrics with a 460 day 1 minute granularity, how about consolidating your key graphs into a new custom dashboard and looking over last year's access and resource statuses with your team members?

Along with this, we’ve restricted the maximum number of alerts that can be obtained at once with the API to 100 cases. To obtain more than 100 alerts, specify `nextId` and retrieve alerts previous to the specified alert id.

## RequestCountPerTarget added to AWS Integration ALB

As requested by users, we added a metric that counts the number of requests for each ALB target group. For more details, refer to the help page linked below.
