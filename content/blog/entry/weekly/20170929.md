On Tuesday, [Mackerel Drink Up #6](https://mackerelio.connpass.com/event/64366/) was held in Osaka where Hatena staff member, id:papix:detail, kicked off the Lightning Talk.

Wednesday, we ran a booth at the [AWS CloudRoadShow 2017](http://roadshow.awseventsjapan.com/nagoya/) in Nagoya and were able to introduce Mackerel to a lot of engineers based in that area.

## “Mackerel Day”, Mackerel’s 3 year anniversary event coming soon!

As of September 17th, it has been three years since the official release of Mackerel. We’ve made it this far, continuing to implement advanced features along the way, all thanks to everyone out there using Mackerel.

To celebrate Mackerel’s 3rd year anniversary and as a thank you to all of our users, we will be holding “Mackerel Day”, a special edition Meetup event!

[https://mackerelio.connpass.com/event/67292/:embed:cite]

We have invited our friends and valued users DMM.com Labo, Freee, GMO Pepabo, and Mercari (in order of presentations) to take to the stage and talk about examples of useful application and the various ways of using Mackerel. Amazon Japan is providing an amazing venue for the event and Tomoaki Sakatoku of Solution Architect will also be speaking. Even Sugiyama,  Ono, and Inoue (me) of Hatena will take the stage!

Everyone from the Mackerel development team will be there for the event and social get-together. This will be an event where users and developers gather under one roof! You definitely don’t want to miss out on this!
