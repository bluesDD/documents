Next week, Mackerel will be running a booth at the 7th Cloud Computing Expo which will be held at the Makuhari Messe on October 26th-28th (Wed-Fri)!

[Cloud Computing EXPO | Lead Exhibitions Japan](http://www.cloud-japan.jp/)

The exhibition will run throughout the three days, so by all means, stop by on a convenient day for you!

## The Metadata feature has been released!

We announced the release of our new metadata feature the other day at [Mackerel Meetup #8](https://mackerel.io/blog/entry/2016/10/18/161951)!

With the metadata feature, any Key-Value can be created in Mackerel as JSON data and we believe that this can serve various purposes.

To begin with, we’ve released a feature to support creating host metadata with the API. Later, we plan on releasing support for the command line tool mkr, plugin maintenance to support metadata, a flexible search feature, and more.

Here's a really unique way that one of our users has experimented with this feature!

The user proposes assigning HP (hit points) to the host like an RPG game! Damage would be given as a penalty if some kind of event were to occur (such as CI failure) and shutdown when the HP reaches 0.

We believe that there’s a variety of other ways that you guys can use this metadata feature. If you come up with a useful case, by all means, send us some feedback!

## You can now specify any request header with external URL monitoring

By configuring external URL monitoring, you can now specify any HTTP request header!

For example, this can be used to set headers needed for user authentication.

However, `User-Agent` will be fixed with a value of `mackerel-http-checker/0.0.1`.

## Authentication method now displayed in Members list

You can now check which method of authentication each member belonging to the organization is using from the Members list screen.

Anyone with the authority of “Administrator” or “Editor” can check this display.

Use it to help make your organization more secure!

## Now accepting applications for Mackerel Hands-On Seminar (2016/11/10)

We have already started accepting applications for the 4th “Mackerel Hands-On Seminar”!

The hands-on seminars being held now are basic level, but we plan to hold an intermediate level seminar before too long.

For anyone interested in the intermediate level seminar, we recommend attending a basic level seminar first. So for those of you who still haven’t attended, here’s your chance!
