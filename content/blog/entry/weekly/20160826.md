Hey! Mackerel sales engineer, id:a-know here. 

I usually work at the office in Minami-aoyama, and this week started off with a typhoon.

At one point Typhoon #10 was heading South, but decided to make a u-turn and is now heading for the Japanese islands so be sure to remain cautious into next week.

Anyways, here is this week’s release information.


## Alert notifications are now re-sent in the event of a failure

Alert notifications received through methods such as e-mail or slack will now be re-sent at defined intervals in the event that the notification fails for whatever reason. 

If the notification failure continues, a retry will occur for a defined number of times while extending the re-sending interval. Please be aware that because of this, there is a possibility that the notification content will be out of order depending on the situation.
