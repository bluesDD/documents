Gion Festival is a highlight of Kyoto every year. As the parade floats line the streets in preparation for the weekend, the festivities before the main event will start today. 
 
Come evening, the streets will be bustling with people, food stalls, and more. 

Here is this week’s update. 

## A plugin to obtain metrics from each CPU core has been added

mackerel-agent, mackerel-agent-plugins, mkr have been released.

The new mackerel-plugin-multicore has been added to mackerel-agent-plugins 0.22.0.

The following two types of graphs are generated in mackerel-plugin-multicore. 

- Graph of CPU metrics for each core
- Graph for the value of loadavg5 divided by the number of cores

In the case of multi-core, the CPU value collected by Mackerel’s standard metric has become the sum of all cores. 

By using mackerel-plugin-multicore, it’s possible to see the CPU metrics for each core individually.

Additionally, even if the number of cores vary for each server, monitoring loadavg5 will become easier with the graph representing the value of loadavg5 divided by the number of cores.

For servers with a large number of cores, the number of host metrics to be collected becomes larger and the billable host count can increase. For more information, visit the link below.
