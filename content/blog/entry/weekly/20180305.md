Hello! Mackerel team CRE Inoue (id:a-know:detail) here.

Although the morning hours are still pretty chilly, the temperature is finally starting to feel a little spring-like. I’ve never had pollen allergies before, but this year my nose is itchy....... It is not pleasant, and maybe if I ignore it, it will go away.

Now on to this week’s update information.

As shown in the image above, it is now possible to display metric graphs in four columns. This can be useful when you want to overlook many graphs at once in a high resolution environment like 4K display.
