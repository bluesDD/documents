HipChat is a private chat service used primarily within companies for real-time, interdepartmental or team-based collaboration with features including file sharing, screen sharing, multiple chat rooms and video chat across different types of devices. 

By registering HipChat as a notification channel with Mackerel, users can have alert information from hosts being monitored by Mackerel sent directly to the appropriate chatroom. When important alerts arise, you can receive the information you need in real-time.
