When using mackerel-agent and AWS/Azure Integration together, the metrics obtained from the two functions are aggregated into one host with a billable rate of either a standard host or a micro host.

- When mackerel-agent is installed on an EC2/Azure VM instance while also using the Integration function: 1 Standard host
- When [using the custom_identifier to aggregate monitors with the plugin](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/integrations/aws#plugin-custom-identifier) for Integration registered hosts in other services: 1 Micro host

However, please note that the upper limit for the number of metrics per host does not change. For other precautions regarding exceeding metrics etc., refer to [Handling of host conversion when plan limits are exceeded](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/faq/contracts/limit-exceeded-conversion).
