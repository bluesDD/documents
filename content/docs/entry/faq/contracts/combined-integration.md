When using mackerel-agent and AWS / Azure Integration together, the metrics obtained from the two features are consolidated into a single host and will incur a usage fee for 1 host.

However, please note that the upper limit for the number of metrics per host does not change. For other precautions in relation to exceeding metrics etc., please refer to [Handling of host conversion when plan limits are exceeded](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/faq/contracts/limit-exceeded-conversion).
