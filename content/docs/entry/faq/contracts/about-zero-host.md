Even if the agent is not installed on any host, or if the moving average of hosts is zero, the minimum usage fee (one host’s worth) will be charged. Therefore, subscribing to the Standard Plan for URL external monitoring purposes only, you will be charged for at least one host’s worth even if you do not register a host.
