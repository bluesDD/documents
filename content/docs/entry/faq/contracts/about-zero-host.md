Yes. It is possible to use functions such as service metrics and external monitoring without registering a host.
However, even if that is the case, you will be charged the minimum rate of one standard host. For more details, please refer to [Calculating the number of hosts](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/faq/contracts/calculate-host-number).
