* First check and see if the mackerel-agent is running or not.
* If the agent is running, check to see if the server's time is configured correctly.
    * If there is a discrepancy between the configured time and the actual current time, there is possibility that data will not be posted correctly.
* There is a short time lag between registering a new host and the first metrics post from that host.
