* In order to receive alert notifications, hosts must be set to the “Working” status.
* The default status for newly registered hosts can be changed in the Settings tab of your organization’s details page. https://mackerel.io/my?tab=setting

* For more information regarding the relationship between hosts’ statuses and notifications, please refer to [Setting up monitoring and alerts]https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/howto/alerts).
