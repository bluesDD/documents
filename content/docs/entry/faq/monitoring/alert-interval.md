* When the Mackerel management server is not receiving transmissions from the agent for a 10 minute period of time, it will be judged as NG.
* Host metric monitors, and check monitors will be judged as OK/NG when data is sent to the Mackerel server.  
* Service metric monitors will be judged as OK/NG when metrics are sent to the Mackerel server.
* External monitors will be checked and judged as OK/NG every minute.
* There is a possibility that in the future the aforementioned check intervals will be revised.
