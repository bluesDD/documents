* If you would like to change an organization’s name or to withdraw from an organization, please log in to Mackerel and contact support by clicking on Feedback. [https://mackerel.io/my?tab=setting]
* Your organization can't be deleted if you are either not the owner of the organization, or if there are other members in your organization. To delete your organization you must log in as the owner and delete all other members first.
* Please keep in mind that it may not be possible to change your organization's name if that name is already being used.
